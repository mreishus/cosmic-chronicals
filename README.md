# Cosmic Chronicals

This project sets up a WordPress environment using Docker for the Cosmic Chronicals workshop.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

### Available Scripts

We provide several scripts to manage the Docker environment:

1. `start.sh`: Starts the WordPress environment.
2. `stop.sh`: Stops the running containers.
3. `reset.sh`: Resets the environment to its initial state.
4. `cleanup.sh`: Removes all Docker resources related to this project.

Once the environment is running, you can access the WordPress site at `http://localhost:9876`.
